### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a senior attending Virginia Commonwealth University to obtain a B.S in computer science under the school's College of Engineering and am looking for software developer/engineer related internship or full-time positions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automating my computer science department's override system and am building a personal website from scratch 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently interested in and learning front-end languages as I believe they feel immediately more rewarding for your effort!
- ðŸ“« If you want to talk feel free to send me an email or contact me [here](https://github.com/saehaana/saehaana/issues)
